 
 This is the simple shell project that mimic some features of the bash shell. 
 The following are the task to be completed in this project;

#  Write a beautiful code that passes the Betty checks

#  Write a UNIX command line interpreter.Your Shell should:
   Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
   The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
   The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
   The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
   If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
   Handle errors.
   You have to handle the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D)

#  Handle command lines with arguments

#  Handle the PATH. fork must not be called if the command doesn’t exist

#  Implement the exit built-in, that exits the shell. Usage: exit
   You don’t have to handle any argument to the built-in exit

# Implement the env built-in, that prints the current environment

# Write your own getline function, 
   Use a buffer to read many chars at once and call the least possible the read system call.
   You will need to use static variables. You are not allowed to use getline

# You are not allowed to use strtok

# handle arguments for the built-in exit
   Usage: exit status, where status is an integer used to exit the shell

# Implement the setenv and unsetenv builtin commands
   setenv:
	Initialize a new environment variable, or modify an existing one
	Command syntax: setenv VARIABLE VALUE
	Should print something on stderr on failure
   unsetenv:
	Remove an environment variable
	Command syntax: unsetenv VARIABLE
	Should print something on stderr on failure

# Implement the builtin command cd:
	Changes the current directory of the process.
	Command syntax: cd [DIRECTORY]
	If no argument is given to cd the command must be interpreted like cd $HOME
	You have to handle the command cd -
	You have to update the environment variable PWD when you change directory
	man chdir, man getcwd

# Handle the commands separator;

# Handle the && and || shell logical operators

# Implement the alias builtin command
	Usage: alias [name[='value'] ...]
	alias: Prints a list of all aliases, one per line, in the form name='value'
	alias name [name2 ...]: Prints the aliases name, name2, etc 1 per line, in the form name='value'
	alias name='value' [...]: Defines an alias for each name whose value is given. If name is already an alias, 
	replaces its value with value

# Handle variables replacement. Handle the $? variable. Handle the $$ variable

# Handle comments (#)

# Usage: simple shell [filename]. Your shell can take a file as a command line argument. 
   The file contains all the commands that your shell should run before exiting. 
   The file should contain one command per line. In this mode, 
   the shell should not print a prompt and should not read from stdin.
